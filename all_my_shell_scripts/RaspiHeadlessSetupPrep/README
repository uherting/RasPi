Introduction to the shell scripts
=================================

The scripts are thought to be helper scripts for downloading, customising,
and writing an image of the Linux distribution Raspbian to a SD card.

Attention
---------
In order to create necessary sym links the script "loop_mount.sh" has to
be executed without any parameters. See section "Additional Customisation"
on how to use them.

Order of execution
------------------
Here are the actions and the commands plus some explanation on the tasks / results.

1) Downloading: raspbian_GetLatest.sh <lite/desktop>
   The latest version of Raspbian will get downloaded. The parameter
   determines whether the lite (no GUI) or desktop version will be
   downloaded.
   The file name will be something like ...
   "2018-06-27-raspbian-stretch-lite.zip". The URL used for the retrieval
   is generic and so it will hopefully work with the next major release
   after stretch.

2) Mounting the image: loop_mount.sh <filenameOfRaspbianImage>

3) Writing customisation to the target directories: write_raspbian_additional.sh

4) Unmounting the image: loop_mount.sh <filenameOfRaspbianImage>

5) Writing the image to the SD card: write_raspbian.sh <lite/desktop>
   This script writes the latest image file to the SD card. The latest
   image is determined by the date/time stamp given in the file name.


Additional Customisation
------------------------
The image can be modified by mounting it as a loop device. This should
be done prior to writing the image to a SD card.

The following scripts take care of mounting / unmounting the image file.
 - Mounting the image: loop_mount.sh <filenameOfRaspbianImage>
 - Unmounting the image: loop_mount.sh <filenameOfRaspbianImage>
